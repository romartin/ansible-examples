# This playbook is an example for deploying multiple instances into
# EC2/Euca and "doing something" with them.
#
# - uses the ec2 and ec2_vol module.
#
# Run this with ansible-playbook and supply the private key for your
# EC2/Euca user (to access the instance in the second play), e.g:
#
# ansible-playbook eucalyptus-ec2-deploy.yml -v --private-key=/path/to/ec2/pri/key
#

# The play operates on the local (Ansible control) machine.
