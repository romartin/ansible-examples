- hosts: all
  roles:
    # a role can be listed flat like this:
    #
    #   - common
    #   - webservers

    # but you can also pass variables to them, so they can be parameterized.  You can call
    # a role more than once with different parameters too.  It might look like this:

    - role: foo
      param1: "{{ foo }}"
      param2: '{{ some_var1 + "/" + some_var2 }}'
      when: ansible_os_family == 'RedHat'

  # add as many roles as you like, roles takes a list of roles names
  # these paths can be qualified, but if bare, it will look from them in
  # roles/{{rolename}} relative to the playbook

  # explicit tasks and handlers can be used, but are not required.
  # they will run after the roles if present.

  tasks:

        # you can still have loose tasks/handlers and they will execute after roles
